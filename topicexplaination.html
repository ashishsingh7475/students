            <h2>Diabetes</h2>
            <p>Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects how your body uses blood sugar (glucose). It can lead to serious health complications if not managed properly. This article provides an overview of diabetes, including its types, causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options.</p>

        <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
        <p>There are several types of diabetes, each with different causes and management strategies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type 1 Diabetes:</strong> An autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. It typically develops in childhood or early adulthood and requires lifelong insulin therapy.</li>
            <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes:</strong> The most common type of diabetes, where the body becomes resistant to insulin or the pancreas does not produce enough insulin. It is often associated with obesity and lifestyle factors and can sometimes be managed with diet and exercise.</li>
            <li><strong>Gestational Diabetes:</strong> A type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and usually disappears after childbirth. However, it increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.</li>
            <li><strong>Other Specific Types:</strong> Includes conditions resulting from genetic mutations, surgery, medications, or other diseases.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>The causes of diabetes vary by type, but common risk factors include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Family history of diabetes increases the risk of developing the condition.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle Factors:</strong> Poor diet, physical inactivity, and obesity are major risk factors, particularly for type 2 diabetes.</li>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Risk increases with age, especially for type 2 diabetes.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Certain ethnic groups, such as African American, Hispanic, and Asian American populations, have a higher risk of developing diabetes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Symptoms of Diabetes</h2>
        <p>Common symptoms of diabetes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Frequent urination</li>
            <li>Excessive thirst</li>
            <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
            <li>Blurred vision</li>
            <li>Slow-healing wounds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>Diabetes is diagnosed through various tests, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fasting Blood Glucose Test:</strong> Measures blood sugar levels after fasting for at least eight hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT):</strong> Measures blood sugar levels after fasting and then drinking a glucose solution.</li>
            <li><strong>Hemoglobin A1c Test:</strong> Reflects average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months.</li>
            <li><strong>Random Blood Glucose Test:</strong> Measures blood sugar levels at any time, regardless of food intake.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment and Management</h2>
        <p>Managing diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and regular monitoring:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Insulin injections or oral medications may be required to control blood sugar levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Diet:</strong> A balanced diet focusing on whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats can help manage blood sugar levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Regular physical activity helps control weight and improve insulin sensitivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels to ensure they remain within the target range.</li>
            <li><strong>Education:</strong> Learning about diabetes and its management is crucial for effective control of the condition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Living with Diabetes</h2>
